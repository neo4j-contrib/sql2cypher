= Sql2Cypher Experimental Transpiler from SQL to Cypher

This library is an experiment for converting SQL statements (first only read statements) to the appropriate Cypher equivalent.

It is currently in a pre-alpha stage.

== Example

For example:

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT t.a, t.b
FROM my_table AS t
WHERE t.a = 1
----

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (T:`MY_TABLE`) 
WHERE T.A = 1 
RETURN T.A, T.B
----

More concrete examples can be found in the link:src/test/resources[TCK].
