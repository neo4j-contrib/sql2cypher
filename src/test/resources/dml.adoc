== Plain `DELETE`

The input

[source,sql,id=t0_0,name=delete]
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t0_0_expected]
----
MATCH (person:person)
DELETE person
----

== `DELETE .. WHERE`

The input

[source,sql,id=t0_1,name=delete]
----
DELETE FROM person
WHERE person.id = 1
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t0_1_expected]
----
MATCH (person:person)
WHERE person.id = 1
DELETE person
----

== Plain `DELETE` with alias

The input

[source,sql,id=t0_2,name=delete]
----
DELETE FROM person p
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t0_2_expected]
----
MATCH (p:person)
DELETE p
----

== Plain `DELETE` with alias and table mapping

The input

[source,sql,id=t0_3,name=delete,table_mappings=person:Person]
----
DELETE FROM person p
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t0_3_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
DELETE p
----

== Truncate

The input

[source,sql,id=t0_4,name=truncate,table_mappings=people:Person]
