= Joins to represent relationships

These tests cover `ON JOIN` syntax to represent relationships

== Foreign Key Joins

The input

[source,sql,id=t1_0,name=foreign_key_join]
----
SELECT p.name, m.title
FROM `Person` as p
JOIN `Movie` as m ON (m.id = p.`DIRECTED`)
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t1_0_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

== Foreign Key Joins with simple syntax

Statements shall be translated when not using backticks etc., too. The input

[source,sql,id=t1_1,name=foreign_key_join_simple,table_mappings=people:Person;movies:Movie]
----
SELECT p.name, m.title
FROM people p
JOIN movies m ON m.id = p.directed
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t1_1_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

== Join Table Joins

The name of the join table will be used as the relationship type.
In the example below, table mappings are configured:

[source,sql,id=t2_0,name=join_table_join,table_mappings=people:Person;movies:Movie;movie_actors:ACTED_IN]
----
SELECT p.name, m.title
FROM people p
JOIN movie_actors r ON r.person_id = p.id
JOIN movies m ON m.id = r.person_id
----

as demonstrated by

[source,cypher,id=t2_0_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

Multiple joins will result in a chain of relationships:

[source,sql,id=t2_1,name=join_multiple_table_join,table_mappings=people:Person;movies:Movie;movie_actors:ACTED_IN;movie_directors:DIRECTED]
----
SELECT p.name AS actor, d.name AS director, m.title
FROM people p
 JOIN movie_actors r ON r.person_id = p.id
 JOIN movies m ON m.id = r.person_id
 JOIN movie_directors r2 ON r2.movie_id = m.id
 JOIN people d ON r2.person_id = d.id
----

as demonstrated by

[source,cypher,id=t2_1_expected]
----
MATCH (p:`Person`)-[r:`ACTED_IN`]->(m:`Movie`)<-[r2:`DIRECTED`]-(d:`Person`)
RETURN p.name AS actor, d.name AS director, m.title
----

Notice how the direction of the `DIRECTED` relationship is defined by the order of the join columns.
