= Tests for logical predicates

These tests cover logical expressions and predicates

== Logical Expressions / Conditions

The input

[source,sql,id=t1_0,name=logic_operators]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE 1 = 1 AND 2 = 2 OR 3 = 3
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t1_0_expected]
----
MATCH (:p)
WHERE ((1 = 1
    AND 2 = 2)
  OR 3 = 3)
RETURN 1
----

The input

[source,sql,id=t1_1,name=logic_operators_rare]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE NOT 1 = 1 XOR 2 = 2
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t1_1_expected]
----
MATCH (:p)
WHERE (NOT (1 = 1)
  XOR 2 = 2)
RETURN 1
----


== Arithmetic Operators

The input

[source,sql,id=t2_0,name=predicates_with_arithmetics]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE 1 = 1 AND 2 > 1 AND 1 < 2 AND 1 <= 2 AND 2 >= 1 AND 1 != 2
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t2_0_expected]
----
MATCH (:p)
WHERE (1 = 1
  AND 2 > 1
  AND 1 < 2
  AND 1 <= 2
  AND 2 >= 1
  AND 1 <> 2)
RETURN 1
----

== Null Handling

The input

[source,sql,id=t3_0,name=predicates_nullability]
----
SELECT 1 FROM p WHERE 1 IS NULL AND 2 IS NOT NULL
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t3_0_expected]
----
MATCH (:p)
WHERE (1 IS NULL
  AND 2 IS NOT NULL)
RETURN 1
----
