= Tests for simple select queries

These tests cover single table selects and basic conditions.

== PoC

The input

[source,sql,id=t1_0,name=select_with_condition]
----
SELECT t.a, t.b
FROM `MY_TABLE` AS t
WHERE t.a = 1
----

will be transpiled to

[source,cypher,id=t1_0_expected]
----
MATCH (t:MY_TABLE)
WHERE t.a = 1
RETURN t.a, t.b
----

[source,sql,id=t1_1,name=no_driving_table]
----
SELECT 1
----

[source,cypher,id=t1_1_expected]
----
RETURN 1
----

== Comparing SQL with Cypher examples

Sources of the following examples are from https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/guide-sql-to-cypher/[Comparing SQL with Cypher].

=== Find all Products

==== Select and Return Records

Easy in SQL, just select everything from the `products` table.

[source,sql,id=t2_0,name=select_and_return_records,table_mappings=products:Product]
----
SELECT p.*
FROM products as p
----

Similarly, in Cypher, you just *match* a simple pattern: all nodes with the *label* `:Product` and `RETURN` them.

[source,cypher,id=t2_0_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN p
----

==== Field Access, Ordering and Paging

*More efficient is to return only a subset of attributes*, like `ProductName` and `UnitPrice`.
And while we're on it, let's also order by price and only return the 10 most expensive items.

[source,sql,id=t2_1,name=field_acces_ordering_paging,table_mappings=products:Product]
----
SELECT p.`productName`, p.`unitPrice`
FROM products as p
ORDER BY p.`unitPrice` DESC
LIMIT 10
----

You can copy and paste the changes from SQL to Cypher, it's thankfully unsurprising.
But remember that labels, relationship-types and property-names are *case sensitive* in Neo4j.

[source,cypher,id=t2_1_expected]
----
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN p.productName, p.unitPrice ORDER BY p.unitPrice DESC LIMIT 10
----
